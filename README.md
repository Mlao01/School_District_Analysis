# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

The school board has notified us that the source data shows evidence of academic hisonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board dooes not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to us for help. We are to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with 'NaNs' while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once the math and reading scores have been replaced, repeat the analysis and describe how the changes affected the overall analysis.
